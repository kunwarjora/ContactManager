# ContactManager

This is a Contact Manager code made in C language.
It uses LinkedList concept in managing the contacts.
A structure of Profile is made. 

We can add new contact, delete contact, rename contact, display information of particular contact, display all contacts, Search a contact, change number of a contact, import and export contacts.

The exported contact are of csv file which we can later import on google contacts and see in our mobile, PCs, etc.
Everytime we export the contact, a log file is maintained which is of txt file which keep tracks of every change made with proper time included.

Problems:
Everytime we have to import the file.
